Based off of jupyter notebook. If you work in Databricks in the past/future this will look similar

There comes a time where your tools just aren't strong enough. It's possibl, but tedious, to just develop in the terminal.

Let's get a notebook going. It will make it easier to debug our workflow

Create a new file called `notebook.ipynb`

It looks like this

We can run whatever python we want in here.

Might need to install Python + Jupyter

Note: Escape then B to create a new box below. You can find jupyter notebook cheat sheets online if needed

Nice and simple let's check what's inside league

If you check how many rosters are in the league you get 12.
So we know there's 6 games each week
```
league['total_rosters']
```
