Aka jupyter notebook, aka databricks.

There comes a time where your tools just aren't strong enough. It's possible but kind of hard to just develop in the terminal.

We can run whatever python we want in here.

Might need to install Python + Jupyter

Nice and simple let's check what's inside league

If you check how many rosters are in the league you get 10.
So we know there's 5 games each week
```
league['total_rosters']
```
