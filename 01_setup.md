#Setup

Okay let's do that create our project folder


Cd (Change directory into your project folder)<br>
$ cd<br>
$ cd Desktop<br>

Let's create the folder<br>
$ mkdir capstone_1<br>

Enter the folder<br>
$ cd capstone_1<br>

Okay let's open VS Code. Don't forget the period!<br>
$ code .<br>

Let's create a new file called test.py Cool run it.<br>



Nice it works!<br>


Cool let's set this virtual environment up.<br>


You get this pop up might as well press yes. It activates the virtual environment automatically<br>

Into the vs code terminal we go<br>
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv<br>




Maybe yours activates the virtual (venv) automatically. If it doesn't just use this<br>
$ . venv/bin/activate<br>


Check the front it says venv.<br>

Congrats you are set up.<br>
