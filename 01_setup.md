Let's create a new file called test.py Cool run it.



Nice it works!


Cool let's set this virtual environment up.


You get this pop up might as well press yes. It activates the virtual environment automatically

Into the vs code terminal we go
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv




Maybe yours activates the virtual (venv) automatically. If it doesn't just use this
$ . venv/bin/activate


Check the front it says venv.

Congrats you are set up.
