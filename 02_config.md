# The Config File

VERY IMPORTANT!!! I JOKE AROUND A LOT IN THE TRAINING. I AM NOT JOKING HERE.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU KEEP SENSITIVE DATA/TOKENS IN GITHUB

I ONLY DO IT HERE FOR TRAINING. ONLY FOR TRAINING. DO NOT USE GITHUB TO STORE TOKENS IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT

Normally you set your settings in a config file.<br>
To store passwords and keys like that. Sensitive information

Let's go ahead a create a ```config.yaml``` file in our /capstone_1 directory. <br>
Set the the league_id to ```993010950145998848```



```
league_id: 993010950145998848
```

It looks like this in your `config.yaml` file

[I REPEAT DO NOT USE GITHUB TO STORE TOKENS IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT]

Let's try testing it!
