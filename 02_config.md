# The Config File


Normally you set your settings in a config file.<br>
To store passwords and keys like that. Sensitive information

Let's go ahead a create a ```config.yaml``` file in our /capstone_1 directory. <br>
Set the the league_id to ```993010950145998848```



```
league_id: 993010950145998848
```

It looks like this in your `config.yaml` file

You do this so people don't take your Sleeper League ID and create python training around your league.


Let's try testing it!
