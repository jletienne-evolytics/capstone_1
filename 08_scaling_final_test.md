# Scaling


Okay the pieces are starting to come together.

We've done some python, some notebook. We're getting there, trust. Let's try wrapping this baby up. Create a file called `get_all_sleeper_data.py`

Now we'll create a folder for all our code. `sleeper_code` is a good name.


Add a file called `get_team_names.py`.


You can use the steps from `07_team_names.ipynb`. We'll create a function called `get_final_teams()`

And on line 49 we can return a nice message!

And now we'll edit our get all sleeper data file. We'll import our standard packages and then we'll import the code we made in `sleeper_code\get_team_names.py`

Look at that beauty. And we have a new modified time in finder.


## Almost

Okay one more file let's call it `sleeper_code\get_team_stats.py`

And let's make some edits to our `get_all_sleeper_data.py` script. Note we added an import statement on line 8

If you make an error read the terminal output for clues how to fix

## Bringing in Team Name

Let's edit `get_team_data.py`, one final time!

And get `get_all_sleeper_data.py`

Open your prod data, it looks beautiful!
